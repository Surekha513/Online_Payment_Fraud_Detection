## **Project Summary**

The Online Payments Fraud Detection System is a machine learning based web application developed to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using the XGBoost algorithm. The system analyzes transaction details such as transaction type, amount, sender balance, and receiver balance to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

The model is trained on historical transaction data and integrated into a Flask backend application to provide real time fraud prediction. The system performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to ensure high accuracy with balanced precision and recall.

The web interface allows users to enter transaction details and instantly receive prediction results. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of machine learning in financial fraud detection and helps improve digital transaction security by reducing financial risks and false predictions.
